Terraform version check (tfvc) is a tool for ensuring that your your Terraform code is always configured to use the latest versions of any referenced providers and modules.

**NOTE: This project is currently under heavy development and things WILL break (probably)**

## Acknowledgements

This project started as a fork of the [github.com/keilerkonzept/terraform-module-versions](https://github.com/keilerkonzept/terraform-module-versions) project. However, given the changes that I needed to make in order to add the features that I wanted to I ended up migrating to this repo. Still, shout out to [keilerkonzept](https://github.com/keilerkonzept) for their work.
